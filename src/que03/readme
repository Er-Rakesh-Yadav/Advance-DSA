There is a unique ATM in Wonderland. Imagine this ATM as an array of numbers. You can withdraw cash
only from either ends of the array. Sarah wants to withdraw X amount of cash from the ATM. What are
the minimum number of withdrawals Sarah would need to accumulate X amount of cash. If it is not
possible for Sarah to withdraw X amount, return -1.

__Input Format__
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in ATM.
Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < N) contains an integer describing the cash in ATM.
The next line contains an integer, X, denoting the total amount to withdraw.

__Constraints__
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= ATM[i] <= 10^5
1 <= X <= 10^5

Sample Input:
2
1
1
3

Sample Output:
-1

Explanation:The total amount of cash in the ATM is 2, hence Sarah cannot withdraw an amount of 3.
