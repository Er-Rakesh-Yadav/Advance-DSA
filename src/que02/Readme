Let's define a Beautiful Function F(x) in such a way : Add 1 to the value of x, if the result of
addition contains any trailing zeros then remove them all.

Examples:
F(11) = 12
F(19) = 2 (20 -> 2)
F(99) = 1 (100 -> 10 -> 1)

Let's define a number to be reachable from x, if we can apply the Beautiful Function some number of
times(possibly zero) to x and get that number as result.
Ex. 102 is reachable from 10099 as (F(F(10099))) = F(101) = 102.

You are given a number N. Calculate how many numbers are reachable from N.

__Input Format__
